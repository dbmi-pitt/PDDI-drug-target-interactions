# this is pseudocode for the gene list
# This uses iterative binary search. This is reasonable since the Big Oh is log n.
# To make this work, you have to know the number of cells in this, which is 26944. It starts at 1.
# I then arranged the file using excel to give the index of the gene which is sorted in order. Nifty huh... Though I hope I didn't kill any important data doint that. 
# I don't konw how to put the txt file in a sort of table but......... I'm doing it in some weird way
# there is a comparator for the alphabet in natural order
